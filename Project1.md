# Project 1

1. If you are rolling 5 dice, determine the probability that the sum of the faces showing up is equal to 21.

2. You're about to get on a plane to Boston. You want to know whether it is raining. You call 4 random friends of yours who live there and ask each one independently, if it's raining. The first two of your friends have a 1/3 chance of telling you the truth and, the other two have 1/4 chance of messing with you by lying. All 4 friends tell you that "No" it isn't raining. What is the probability that it's raining in Boston?

3. Mad Max wants to travel from New York to Dallas by the shortest possible route. He may travel over the routes shown in the table below. Unfortunately, the Wicked Witch can block one road leading out of Atlanta and one road leading out of Nashville. Mad Max will not know which roads have been blocked until he arrives at Atlanta or Nashville. Should Mad Max start toward Atlanta or Nashville?
